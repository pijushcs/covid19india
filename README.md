Covid19 India Status

You can now track the current status in India directly from chrome with this extension. We have a simulation for you to understand the importance of lockdown. Though we aren't official, we collect the data from the highly valued unofficial corwdsourced datasource.

Thanks to https://github.com/amodm/api-covid19-in, the volunteers of www.covid19india.org for providing the required data and chart.js team for such visualisation and analysis!
